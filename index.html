                <h2 align="center">Welcome to my Page!</h2>
                <p> I am a second year graduate student at the <a href="http://me.eng.ua.edu/"> University of Alabama </a> 
                    pursuing a Master's of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Thermal
                    Sciences. I am also the VP of Research and Development for the
                    <a href="https://alabamarocketry.squarespace.com/about-us"> Alabama Rocketry Association (ARA). </a>
                    My current research interest focuses on increasing thermodynamic 
                    efficiency for 
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/Nuclear_Thermal_Propulsion_Deep_Space_Exploration"> nuclear thermal rockets (NTR)</a>
                    for a Mars based mission. In addition to the NTR research, I am also very interested in 
                    Astronomy and Astrophysics and enjoy utilizing my data science and analytics skills.

                <h4><u>Thermodynamic Efficiency of Nuclear Thermal Rockets (NTR)</u></h4>
                
                <p> 
                    My current research interests focus on increasing thermodynamic efficiency for 
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/Nuclear_Thermal_Propulsion_Deep_Space_Exploration"> nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) methods</a>
                    for a Mars based mission. Traditionally, nuclear reactor cooling channels have a circular 
                    geometry. However, with current additive manufacturing technologies, complex geometries 
                    are able to be manufactured and studied for future use. If other non-circular cross sectional 
                    cooling channels are able to increase the thermodynamic efficiency of the reactor, said 
                    geometry may be worth pursuing for further study.

                <p>
                    In addition to the NTR research, I also serve as the graduate advisor and
                    program manager (PM) for the ARA controllable CGT project. As the PM of the CGT team, 
                    I oversee the budget and timeline for the research, design, analysis, and development
                    of an omnidirectional controllable inert gas thruster system.
